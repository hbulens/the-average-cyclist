## Route

This is an absolute beauty of a ride. La Carretera de la Cabra, the Goat's Path, connects Almuñecar to the magnificant city of Granada, and was originally used to transport fish on the back of mules to the city.
It took them two days to traverse the path. Today, it is an attractive area for hikers, bikers, and cyclists. 
The pros are known to frequent this route a lot when they're preparing for the Tour de France on their altitude camp in the Sierra Nevada.

The ride starts on the coast in **Almuñecar**. Once of historic importance to the Phoenicians and the Romans, now a great base for tourism at the less-visited Costa Tropical.
There are a few decent diving spots at the neighbouring La Herradura ('The Horseshoe'), places for sightseeing in the town itself such as the castle, beaches, water holes (Rio Verde in nearby Otívar), and it's a good starting point to go up the Goat's Path.

&nbsp;

Almuñecar is not a big town, so you'll be out and about in the countryside in no time. Look for the A-4050 and once you're on it, that's the only road you have to follow for the next 30 km.
In contrast to many other rides that start from the coast, the start is actually quite relaxed and it only goes uphill ever so slightly, so you can warm up your legs for once before the climbing starts.

&nbsp;

The first kilometers of this road aren't anything to write home about, but it won't take long before you ride in beautiful countryside. Along the way are two small villages, **Jete** and **Otívar**.
Once out of Otívar is where the gradients start to kick up.
