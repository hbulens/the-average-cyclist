## Route

This is an absolute beauty of a ride. La Carretera de la Cabra, the Goat's Path, connects Almu√±ecar to the historic city of Granada, and was originally used to transport fish on the back of mules to the city.
It took them two days to traverse the path. Today, it is an attractive area for hikers, bikers, and cyclists. 
The pros are known to frequent this route a lot when they're preparing for the Tour de France on their altitude camp in the Sierra Nevada.
