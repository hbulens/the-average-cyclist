When you reach the top, it goes downhill straight away, and it's a quick descent. 
Once you've gone under the bridge of the E-15 highway and crossed the two roundabouts, traffic tends to be busier here. 
Fortunately, it's only a few more kilometers of downhill before you reach the good old coastal road.
Go right and you'll quickly arrive in Benajarafe and the other coastal towns littered on route to Málaga.

## Fueling up

At the top, there conveniently is a venta: Venta La Loma.
On the coastal road in Benajarafe, there are many more cafeterías on route where you could take a break of this traditional coffee ride.

## Tips

Apart from the climb, the coastal road and Veléz-Málaga can get quite busy. Leave early while everybody's still asleep to get the most out of this route.
