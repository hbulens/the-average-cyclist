## Route

Despite its fame with the pros and amateurs, Rocacorba is not a climb that the regular Joe will know.
It has and might never have cycling history, although you never know with the sensation-seeking organizers of the Vuelta a España.
However, it has made a name for itself in a different way. 

&nbsp;

It has been the climb of choice of the local pros go to test themselves in their preparation to a grand tour.
Not too long ago, this was just a dirt track that leads to a dead end with the broadcasting towers at the summit.
The only missing piece, apparently, to quickly become the most famous climb in the area and attract some of the best riders in the world, was a little bit of rough tarmac.
Its popularity has skyrocketed since then where cyclists try to get near the times of grand tour winners, who hover around the 30 minute mark. 
That's insanely fast, and you should be happy that you can do the climb in less than an hour. 
Knowing that Bradley Wiggins allegedly came here in a skin suit and did a warmup on the rollers to become the KOM, you know you don't stand a chance. 
And you also need to get back to Girona afterwards, so you can't go all out unless you want to have the most miserable 50 km back to Girona.

&nbsp;

To be frank, it's one of the only things you can think about when you're on the Rocacorba. 
You can see the eyesoring broadcasting towers from far away, which may make you believe you'll be high above everything and spectacular views will be around every corner.
Not so, but you do get a great view at the top. But for pretty much the entire duration of the climb won't there be any views worth mentioning.
Not that you'll have much time to look around, because the road surface is pretty bad at times.

&nbsp;

It's easy to see why the pros like this ride. 
It's not too long, its average of 7% is what they're often presented in the Alps and Pyrenees, it's got a 2 km stretch with averages over 10%, and since it doesn't go anywhere, there is no traffic whatsoever.

The climb starts off very gently with respectable gradients, making you wonder what the fuss is all about.
Don't be fooled because the middle part is really tough, and it doesn't really easy off until you get to the summit.
Somewhere around the halfway mark is where the gradient gets punishing. Averaging around 10% with peaks up to 15% for 2 kilometers: even the pros suffer in this part.
As you quickly gain altitude, you may get a glimpse of the god awful television towers, but it may as well be the most beautiful thing you ever saw as it tells you're getting close to the summit.
There's even a tiny section downhill between the two hard parts. 
The last 2 km or so would usually be not such a big deal with an average of 8%, but here your legs feel like lead and it feels like a tortoise would go faster than you.
A few minutes and some sharp corners later, you'll see some lovely concrete walls and more importantly, the finishing line. 
There's one drawn on the road, and the other finishing line is the end of the road and the fencing around the television towers.

&nbsp;

There's nothing at the top except for the famous Rocacorba sign, and the paragliding platform is a good place to sit down for a minute and enjoy the views, and just realize what kind of monster athletes professional cyclists are when you compare the times.
When you're rested, you just head back the same way you came. There are more climbs in the area, so you can make a monster ride, or you can just head back to Girona. 
It's roughly 30 kilometers to get there, although the most direct way is not the nicest. Fortunately, there are enough smaller and nicer roads that will take you to Banyoles.
Alternatively, you can start in Banyoles, do a loop around the lake before you start the climb. 

&nbsp;

Despite what many say and write, Rocacorba is not one of those climbs that you should have done once in your life.
If you have the time and you want to tick this one off your list, then you won't regret it. 
There are other rides and climbs that are much more enjoyable and beautiful than this one, so you're really spoilt for choice in this neck of the woods.

## Fueling up

To celebrate with a beer or a coffee, there are a few cafeterías at the lakeside of Banyoles. Halfway up the Rocacorba, there is a fridge at the gate of a house on the left hand side of the road where you can buy drinks. It's unmanned and uses the honor system, which I find beautiful.
The locals embrace and welcome cyclists rather than complain and drive them off the road, the least we can do is pay our respects with a few euros for a refreshing drink.
