## Route

If you're looking for a ride that wents to set your legs on fire, then this is it. 
While it is a pleasant ride for most of the route, the Mare de Déu del Mont is one of the harder climbs you can do in the area.

&nbsp;

As you can tell from the route profile, this climb is the highlight of the route. 
Getting to and from the mountain shouldn't take too much energy from you, despite being undulating terrain in this beautiful part of the world.
You'll be mostly riding on narrow roads with very little traffic, until you get to Esponèlla where you will get to the main road that snakes from town to town.
From here, it's only going to be uphill until you reach the summit. That's 25 kilometers pretty much non-stop climbing. 
That said, it's only the last 10 kilometers that one would count as the proper climb.

&nbsp;

When you reach a crossroad with a restaurant across the street, go straight and take the first road to the left.
This is the road that leads to the sanctuary. Enjoy the scenery while it lasts, because soon you'll be riding in the forest on punishing slopes.
Shortly when you leave the town of San Martín Sesserres is when the madness begins.

It's not so much the average gradient that makes this climb so hard.
This climb feels like a rollercoaster where you will go from a flat and even slightly downhill section to a wall of 15% in just a few meters.
It's a cruel climb and you won't ever be able to get into a steady cadence. 
Those who watch pro cycling but never have done any racing, will understand from this climb how GC contenders often do more damage on less steeper parts than on the really steep ramps.

It's another dead-end road to a sanctuary that also houses a cafetería, which attracts a fair number of tourists. 
Hence, you won't be alone in your suffer fest, although most will fly by in their cars and buses. 
If you have bad luck, you'll have to take the 20% inside corner if there's a car coming down the hill.

&nbsp;

In the last few kilometers, you'll rise above the tree line and you'll start to get a glimpse of the sanctuary.
No time to relax yet because the last kilometers are tough with more of the same jumps in gradient, albeit less extreme than before.
9% with ramps to 15% is no walk in the park in this spectacular climb, and it keeps going uphill until the very last meter of tarmac next to the sanctuary.

&nbsp;

The views on the summit are breathtaking. 
You have a 360 degree view of the area, and that includes the nearby snow-capped Pyrenees.
