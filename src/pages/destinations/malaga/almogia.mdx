## The route

The climb to Almogía via the old road up via the lake is one of the most enjoyable in the area.
The only other road leading up to Almogía is one of the toughest, so when planning your route, make sure to follow the road with the many twists and turns on the west side of the lake.

&nbsp;

Getting out of town to the west is hallmarked by the world's worst aligned traffic lights. Unless you ride very fast, you'll have to do a lot of stopping and starting.
The Avenida de Carlos Haya is a busy avenue, but it's got two lanes going in each direction, and the first lane as anywhere else is reserved for cyclists, scooters, and other slow traffic. 
Not that the locals pay much attention to that, but at least it's an attempt to make up for the complete lack of cycle lanes.

&nbsp;

You can follow this road until you get to Puerto de La Torre, and eventually to the roundabout and the ramp off the highway.
This road takes a little detour via slightly quieter roads that avoid riding through Puerto de La Torre's center, and it converges with the main road near the Aldi supermarket.

&nbsp;

Once you've gone straight after the big roundabout, you're almost done with urban riding.
Up until this point, you've done nothing but climb, but you'll be flying down through a little settlement. 
When you see the training ground of El Torcal driving school, a fun ride finally awaits you.
The road is undulating for the next few kilometers and rather pleasant with nice views over the small valley.
When you reach the Venta la Tinaja, go left at the crossroads. You can go right too, see [alternative routes](#alternative-routes) for more information.

&nbsp;

When you cross the iron bridge, the actual climb to Almogía begins. The first kilometers are the hardest and it eases off towards the end.
On the way you'll have views of the dam of Casasola and the lake, and you might share the road with goats and the occasional boars passing by.
It's a steady 7 kilometer ride to Almogía, which welcomes you with spectacular views, a podium for cyclists and a water source to fill up your bottles. 
Or you head to the village and stop for a coffee in the one of the cafeterías along the way. After Almogía, there's no chance to stock up until you get to Villanueva de La Concepción.

&nbsp;

The only road north keeps going up until the urbanización of El Curato, after which the terrain changes drastically.
You ride on a plateau with incredible views of the area, including the spectacular El Torcal natural park. 
It's constant up and down until you reach Villanueva de La Concepción.
