        <h2 class="text-3xl font-medium leading-none">The route</h2>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Starting in Málaga city, it's uphill from the very start. The only
          flat piece of road you will find in these parts is the Paseo Maritimo;
          you could take a quick spin to Pedrejalego and come back before you
          start climbing.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          The route is essentially going up and down the Puerto del Léon. It is
          a climb that has a bit of everything: it's got steep bits, it's got
          relatively flat sections and even a tiny bit of descent before you
          tackle the last 2 hard kilometers. There are hairpin corners and even
          two tiny tunnels halfway up the climb.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          Don't be fooled by the statistics: 16km at 5.6% on average hardly
          sounds like a tough challenge. The difficulty of the climb, as is with
          many Spanish climbs, is that you can never find a rythm due to the
          constants changes in the gradient.

          />

          As you leave Málaga's center at the roundabout of Olletas, 5 tough
          kilometers will get you warmed up right away. Sections of 10% are
          rewarded by relative flat areas, and you'll repeat that until you pass
          the first venta, a roadside restaurant, Venta Carlos del Mirador.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-medium leading-none">Fueling up</h2>
        <p class="mt-4">
          The route is only 50 kilometers long, so you could easily fill up your
          bottles before you set off. Along the A-7000, which is the road
          leading up to Puerto Léon, there are several roadside restaurants
          where you could take a short break. At the top of the climb, you
          arrive at Fuente de la Reina, which throughout most of the year has a
          water source with potable water. Don't count on it in Summer though.
          Next to the water source is yet another cafe, popular with
          motorcyclists and car enthusiasts, and 200 meter down the road is
          another restaurant that serves hearty meals.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          On the way down, there's also a little cafe in the settlement of
          Olías. A few kilometers down, you arrive back in El Palo where you
          will find ample establishments to reward yourself with a coffee or
          something stronger.

        <h2 class="text-3xl font-medium leading-none">Good to know</h2>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium mt-4">Alternative routes</h3>

        <p class="mt-4">
          The reversed route is just as nice. Even better is that you have about
          10km of warmup along the flat coastal road before you begin the climb.
          The climb to Olías has lots of twists and turns and can be more
          enjoyable than the ascent along the A-7000, although the road surface
          is not of the same quality. Beware that you will have to face 'El Muro
          de Olías' shortly after having left Olías. It's a 1km ramp with
          sections up to 17%, and it continues for a while before you reach the
          summit, so don't go all out on the first part of the climb towards
          Olías.
        </p>

        <p class="mt-4">
          If you don't feel like climbing the wall, you could take a right turn
          upon leaving Olías (MA-3202) that will take you to Totalán and back
          down to La Cala de Moral. It's a technical and at times steep decent
          on a rather narrow road with lots of blind corners, so stay focused.
          When you're down at the coast, you'll have to go on a dual-carriage
          way (the MA-24) along the scenic cement factory for 2 km and will take
          you back to El Palo and Málaga.
        </p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-medium mt-4">Tip</h3>

        <p class="mt-4">
          This is a popular route with motorcyclists and car enthusiasts during
          weekends and holidays. Some of the drivers have very little awareness
          of cyclists and will go very fast with little regard of what comes
          behind the bend. Although it is generally very safe and the Spanish
          are the most courteous drivers toward cyclists in the entire world, I
          suggest doing this route early in the morning on a weekday. You'll be
          sharing the road only with squirrels, boars that cross the road, the
          odd farmer that has to attend to this farm in the beautiful Montes de
          Málaga. If you're planning to do this route in Summer, you'll want to
          ride early anyway as temperatures quickly rise up to 30 degrees, even when
          the sun hasn't risen yet.
