<h2 class="text-3xl font-medium leading-none mb-4">The route</h2>

Starting in Málaga city, it's uphill from the very start. The only
flat piece of road you will find in these parts is the Paseo Maritimo;
you could take a quick spin to Pedrejalego and come back before you
start climbing.

<br/>

The route is essentially going up and down the Puerto del Léon. It is
a climb that has a bit of everything: it's got steep bits, it's got
relatively flat sections and even a tiny bit of descent before you
tackle the last 2 hard kilometers. There are hairpin corners and even
two tiny tunnels halfway up the climb.

<br/>

Don't be fooled by the statistics: 16km at 5.6% on average hardly
sounds like a tough challenge. The difficulty of the climb, as is with
many Spanish climbs, is that you can never find a rythm due to the
constants changes in the gradient.

<br/>

As you leave Málaga's center at the roundabout of Olletas, 5 tough
kilometers will get you warmed up right away. Sections of 10% are
rewarded by relative flat areas, and you'll repeat that until you pass
the first venta, a roadside restaurant, Venta Carlos del Mirador.
