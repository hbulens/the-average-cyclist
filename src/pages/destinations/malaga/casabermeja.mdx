## The route

Unless you head out west, most of the routes that start in MÃ¡laga take you on roads that go uphill.
This route does too and leads you out of the city via the botanical garden and along a less pitoresque road next to the highway. 
Once you've reached the top of this road, you leave the chaos behind and enter a different world. Passed the artificial lake and dam of Agujero, a long and undulating climb to Casabermeja awaits you.

This climb really consists of 4 uphill sections. If you count the part of getting to the lake as a hill, this climb is 28 km long in total with 5 uphill sections and 4 short descents.
The first section after the lake is **the perfect training climb**. It's a smooth ribbon of tarmac with many turns and it never gets really steep, even though there are short ramps that flirt with the 10% gradient. It's also not too long before you reach Vendo Miel, which heralds the summit of this part of the climb.
At Vendo Miel, you have a viewpoint of the Guadalhorce valley, and if you feel like stopping, you could take a selfie with one of the several cats that linger around.

A short descent is on the menu for the next few kilometers. It is not an overly technical descent but the road surface isn't in the same shape as one can expect from the Spanish roads.
A final dive should launch you to tackle the hardest part of this climb, and while it is merely 2 kilometers long, the going gets tough, and is excarcerbated by little protection from the sun and a relatively bad road surface. At least the gradients are constants and allow you to get into your rhythm.
When you think you've reached the summit - and your Garmin computer will tell you that, you haven't actually reached the top. You may be tempted to switch to the big ring, but the road quietly keeps on creeping up for a kilometer or 2. Only then is there a quick descent along a little settlement where you'll most likely have to navigate through the goats and friendly dogs to start climbing again.

The third stage of the climb is also a short one that mercifully has a constant gradient of about 7%.
