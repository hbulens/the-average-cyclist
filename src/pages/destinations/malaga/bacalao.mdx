## Route

This is one of the several routes in the area that follow the same pattern: you head east on the coastal road to Nerja, 
turn left at some village on the way, climb 15 kilometers inland, descend to Veléz-Málaga and go back to Málaga via the coastal road.

&nbsp;

For particular route, it is actually more enjoyable to do the loop from Veléz, because the climb that you approach from Cajiz is a rather tough one.
It's a short but steep climb from this side, while from Veléz-Málaga it's easy and thus pleasant riding with gentle slopes and great views of the area.

&nbsp;

Either way, you'll get at least 20 km of warming up on the coastal road before anything worth mentioning is presented to your wheels.
This route once again passes the city of Veléz-Málaga, passed the aerodrome and onwards to Benamocarra, where the climbing begins.
Don't be thrown off by the steep bits up right after the roundabout, it doesn't very long and it's mostly easy climbing. 
Only at the very end of the climb will you encounter another of these sudden steeper ramps.

&nbsp;

The road between Benamocarra and Cajiz is cycling heaven. Perfect road, very little traffic, pleasant views, gentle slopes, many corners, this road has it all.
On the way is another typical Andalucian white village, Iznate, but otherwise it's just you surrounded by almond trees, olive groves, vineyards, and more of the local produce.

&nbsp;

When you reach the top, it goes downhill straight away, and it's a quick descent. 
Once you've gone under the bridge of the E-15 highway and crossed the two roundabouts, traffic tends to be busier here. 
Fortunately, it's only a few more kilometers of downhill before you reach the good old coastal road.
Go right and you'll quickly arrive in Benajarafe and the other coastal towns littered on route to Málaga.

## Fueling up

At the top, there conveniently is a venta: Venta La Loma.
On the coastal road in Benajarafe, there are many more cafeterías on route where you could take a break of this traditional coffee ride.

## Tips

Apart from the climb, the coastal road and Veléz-Málaga can get quite busy. Leave early while everybody's still asleep to get the most out of this route.
