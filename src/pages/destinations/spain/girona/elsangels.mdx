## Route

This is the classic ride in Girona, and may well be the one you do first when you arrive in Girona. 
It's the embodiment of what riding in this area is like: thin traffic, fantastic roads, great car culture, amazing views, good climate, super friendly locals, and of course great rides and climbs. 
To top it off, the gravel scene is also strong, making this one of the best areas in the world for cyclists.
It's easy to understand why so many pros live here permanently. An added bonus is that it's not just all climbing in this area, there's a good amount of Spanish flat roads if you don't feel like doing a whole lot of climbing. 
Climbs like Èls Angels are quite gentle and you could do this ride for any occasion.

&nbsp;

The ride starts in Girona, which as in any city, isn't quite that enjoyable. 
The town council hasn't heard of green waves yet it seems, so there's no shadow of a doubt that you'll have to stop for every red traffic light in a 10 km radius.
Fortunately, Girona isn't a large city and it doesn't really stretch out, so you'll be out of the city quickly. 
And once you've passed the ramp to the highway, traffic sort of stops altogether and the only sound you'll hear is the heavy breathing of the cyclists around, as that's when the Èls Angels begins.

&nbsp;

The climb is lovely. It's not dramatic or overly spectacular, and it doesn't have killer sections or any other highlights. It's just nice.
There are few moments of respite and even brief sections of downhill. It goes on like that for most of the climb, all the way to the summit in fact.
At the summit is a cross of Santuari dels Àngels. The sanctuary is a bit further down the road if you turn left. This route sticks to the main road though.

&nbsp;

The descent of Èls Angels is a tad shorter, hence tougher than the side from Girona. It's a really fun descent with a few blind corners, although nothing to worry about.
You know you've made it all the way down when you see a view that looks like a painting, with views of pittoresque **Madremanya**.
At the crossroads, turn right when you can enjoy the gorgeous scenery. You go from village to village for about 8 km until the second climb of the day, George Hincapie hill.

&nbsp;

The second climb is steady and isn't as undulating as the first. 
You find a gear you're comfortable in and you stay there, and you appreciate how green this area is, and also how quiet this place is. 
None of that remains when you reach the other side of the summit, so enjoy it while it lasts.

&nbsp;

When you're Cassà de la Selva, you can make a beeline for Girona, or you can ride on a little bit west and find the road GIV-6742 to Sant Andreu Salou.
The road drops you off in downtown Girona next to the train tracks, where you can admire the worst aligned traffic lights in Cataluña at full chat.
