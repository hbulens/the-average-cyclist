            A long-term traveler with a deep love for discovering new places, I
            spent years exploring South America, Europe, and Southeast Asia
            before deciding to stay in Andalucía.
          </p>

          <p>
            Drawn by the region’s rich culture, stunning landscapes, and endless
            sunshine, I found the perfect spot to settle for a while. It’s here
            in Spain that I rekindled my passion for cycling, thanks to the
            excellent roads and scenic routes that the area offers. Now, my
            journey continues with a blend of local living and exploring the
            beauty of Andalucía, one ride at a time.

            Although I’m reasonably well-trained, I’m an exactly average
            cyclist—on Strava and timed sections of challenges, you’ll usually
            find me somewhere near the middle of the pack. This website is for
            regular riders like me—those who love getting out on the weekends
            but don’t have the time to ride five times a week or spend 20 hours
            on the bike. If you’re looking for relatable cycling stories,
            routes, and tips that fit into a balanced life, you’re in the right
            place.
